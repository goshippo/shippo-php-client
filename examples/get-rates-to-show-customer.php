/* 
In this tutorial we have an order with a sender address,
recipient address and parcel. We will retrieve all avail-
able shipping rates, display them to the user and purchase
a label after the user has selected a rate.

Sample output:
Available rates:
--> USPS - Priority Mail Express
  --> Amount: 28.31
  --> Days to delivery: 1
--> USPS - Priority Mail
  --> Amount: 6.25
  --> Days to delivery: 2
--> USPS - Parcel Select
  --> Amount: 6.72
  --> Days to delivery: 7

--> Shipping label url: https://shippo-delivery-east.s3.amazonaws.com/fb199cfef3164852bf0eea04c082ba6e.pdf?Signature=rMndAoIyKPekw7PZtwzrnOqFlOY%3D&Expires=1510333434&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJGLCC5MYLLWIG42A
--> Shipping tracking number: 9205590164917330560380
